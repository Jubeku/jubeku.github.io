Hurray, I submitted my thesis manuscript! The defense will take place on November 27, 2019.

During the 3 years of my work, I studied seismic waves generated by rockfalls. For this, I numerically simulated the seismic wave propagation using the Spectral Element Method (SEM). Subsequently, I compared simulations with observed seismic signals generated by rockfalls at Dolomieu crater on Piton de la Fournaise volcano, La RÃ©union.

Stay tuned for publications and the thesis manuscript which I will upload here!
