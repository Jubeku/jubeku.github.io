Highly recommended: Alan Turing Institute's Data Study Group in London! 

The Data Study Group was an inspiring week full of great encounters and interesting project. With my team of around 15 data scientists from diverse backgrounds I worked on the semantic segmentation of 3D Point Clouds, proposed by <a href="https://www.sensat.co.uk/">**Sensat**</a>.

The other challenge owners and their projects:

* **WWF:** Smart monitoring for conservation areas
* **Dstl:** Identification of hazardous chemical and biological contamination on surfaces using spectral signatures
* **Dstl:** Bright-field image segmentation
* **The National Archives:** Discovering topics and trends in the UK Government Web Archive
* **Agile Datum:** Automating the evaluation of local government planning applications

Stay tuned for the reports which will be available online soon!
