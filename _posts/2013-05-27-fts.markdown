The objective of this project was to install a parabolic collection mirror in front of a vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) Fourier transform spectrometer in order to enable measurements even in case of low beam intensities. The set-up of the spectrometer is illustrated in the sketch below with collection mirror *C*. The instrument was first tested with visible light before moving it to the HHG-laboratory where measurements with high-energy pulses were conducted.
